To multiply these two matrices, we multiply the corresponding entries and sum them up.

First, let's calculate the entry in the first row and first column:

(1*2) + (0*0) = 2 + 0 = 2

Next, the entry in the first row and second column:

(1*0) + (0*3) = 0 + 0 = 0

Moving on to the second row, first column:

(0*2) + (1*0) = 0 + 0 = 0

Finally, the entry in the second row and second column:

(0*0) + (1*3) = 0 + 3 = 3

Putting it all together, the resulting matrix is:

\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
0 & 3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
